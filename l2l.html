            <h2>Command Line</h2>
            <h6>02/21/2018</h6>
            <p>I am learning the Command Line today. It's the first step into the developer world. A more powerful and faster way to control your computer.

                    Before even starting to study, my computer needed a little better organizing. Closed all the unneccessary windows, turned off the notifications, and muted my phone.It feels a lot better working on a clean screen. And opened my notes application, created a new page. It always helps me understand better if I take notes while learning.
                    
                    I had never used command line before until I decided to step into this magical world of programming. At first it seems like I have to memorize every command, but as I started to play with them a little, it started to make sense. For example, '-A' means select all, and you can use it every time you want to run a command selecting all the files, or directories. Removing all the files, or moving all the directories, etc.
                    
                    It's obvious that these infinite numbers of commands can be learned by practice. So, I started to create some directories and files, and moved them around, and renamed, copied, removed.
                    
                    Maybe, in the future, these commands can be customized by every user, so I can assign my own commands and maybe a make it a little easier to use.
                    
                    Command line looked like a dark scary screen at first but as I started to play with it, and once I felt the power of it, things started make a lot of sense. There is still a lot to learn, a lot of commands, and for that, practise, practise, and more practise...</p>

            <h2>Git and Github</h2>
            <h6>02/22/2018</h6>
            <p>It's Git and Github today. Another fundamental tool for programming. To start coding I have to be very comfortable using this tool.

                    I went to a quite room where I can focus better. I closed all the unrelated tabs on Chrome, opened my notes screeen of course. This time I also grabbed my little notebook and a pen. This is not to take notes about what I am learning, this is to right down the things that come to my mind that I have to do. Like paying the bills, etc. This way they won't keep my mind busy, but also, I won't forget them.
                    
                    Git is a must to have before you start to code. So far, it is the only source cotrol system, but it looks and sounds the most powerful one. You can track changes on your project if you need to go back and fix something from the past. I had always wondered how teams of programmers worked on a project, all seperately on their computers, even remotely. Git and Github is all you need to do this perfectly.
                    
                    At first I was a little nervous about doing something wrong, but after going through some tutorials, then I started to play with it a little. Most of the time I wasn't able to do what I meant to do, but at least everything was fixable. I love how you can control it on the command line.
                    
                    Git and Github are as complicated as they look I think. There are a lot of new terms that I hadn't seen in my life before. I am a little worried, because this is a very important thing to learn for coding, but at the same time, knowing that I will use it every day makes me think that I will learn it even if I don't want to. I will try to find some videos about Git and Github where I can understand better as I see how other people use it.</p>

            <h2>Flexbox</h2>
            <h6>02/28/2018</h6>
            <p>The topic is Flexbox today. It is a new feature in CSS. I am working on a website project, so I have to do my website's layout with Flexbox.

                    I went to the 4th floor at school building, found a quite spot, cleaned all the unneccesary windows and unrelated tabs, and opened my notes application as always.
                    
                    I just attended a break-out session about Flexbox, with Brooks. I had been studying Flexbox for the last couple of days, but didn't really understand it well until just today. Brooks did a really good job explaining it in a very simple way. I can now use two crutial tools for CSS and Flexbox; Devtools on Chrome and CSS Tricks website. Very very helpful. I was able to work on my website in a better way. I open my website on chrome, and open the Devtools, play with it, anything looks good, then go apply it to my code.
                    
                    Flexbox is very difficult yet very fun once I learned a little what I was doing. I think the best way for me to work with Flexbox is to draw boxes inside boxes and containers first, and see how many containers and boxes I need before I start writing my code. Flexbox Froggy, Devtools, CSS tricks and a really good break-out I finally feel a little confident with CSS.</p>
