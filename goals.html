            <h2>Command Line</h2>
            <h6>02/21/2018</h6>
            <ul class="daily-goals">
                <li>Learn what Terminal is(where to find it, how to launch, and what to use for)</li>
                <li>Learn the basic and most common commands</li>
                <li>Practise the commands you learned, create some fake actions to exercise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My goals were met today. That dark scary terminal screen is actually not that difficult to learn, at least the basics. Learned how to launch it only using the keyboard, and installed some cool packages which makes it a little easier to read. The break-out session with Casey was really helpful.

                    We learned the most common commands at the break-out. After feeling a little comfortable, I started to play with it a little. I created a lot of folders and files, moved them around, etc. Practising like this was super helpful. But one thing I am going to do tomorrow is to read the the tutorials first before I jump directly in it. So, maybe I can write a more specific goal, saying; '- Watch some videos about the basic Command Line commands'.

            <h2>Git and Github</h2>
            <h6>02/22/2018</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Read all the tutorials at Galvanize's Learn portal about Git and Github and watch some YouTube videos if neccesary.</li>
                <li>Learn how to use Git on the Command Line.</li>
                <li>Work on how to push and pull changes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My goals were not completely met today. Reading and watching the tutorials helped a lot for sure, but I did't set a timeline for myself, so, I found myself watching videos for hours. I fell a back a little. So, I did't have any time left to do anything about the last goal. I will have to study more on that tonight.

                    Tomorrow, I will put some estimated time for each of my goals. That way I can work on each of my goals.

            <h2>Flexbox</h2>
            <h6>02/28/2018</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Read all CSS tutorials</li>
                <li>Learn Flexbox</li>
                <li>Do multi page website drill-1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My goals were partly met today. Reading the tutorials was definitely a good idea, but in CSS, there is infinite amount of things to learn that can't be fit in one day. So, I had to change my goals a little bit, and only focus on Flexbox instead of entire CSS. I did a lot of practise on Flexbox, especially Flexbox Froggy was very helpful.

                    Today, my goals weren't set very good, but it was still a productive day for me after I changed my goals a little. Tomorrow, I will have to set more realistic and achievable goals.
