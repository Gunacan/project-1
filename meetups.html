            <h2>Front Range Front-End Meetup: CSS Basics - Selectors</h2>
            <h6>03/01/2018</h6>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>James Steinbach</strong> - UX developer at Dockyard, out of Boston. James led the meetup and gave the presentation on CSS selectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Nathan Pitts</strong> - Front-end developer at eScience Labs in Denver. Nathan was attending to learn more about CSS and meet other front-end developers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This learning meet-up was a really fast one. I couldn't keep up with the pace of the presenter. James, the presenter talked about almost everything about the CSS Selectors. He talked about pseudo elements, and pseudo classes where you can select only the lines or a small part of a paragraph. He also talked about the specificity(I just learned this was a word :) chart. 'Id' is the most specific one for example. We also learned about how to select the child elements using the '.' between the parent and the child element. This method was called compound selectors I think. James also talked about how to combine selectors and the different ways of doing that. Compound, descendant, child, siblings. Most of these things, I hadn't heard before, so, even though it was a lot of information in a short period of time, I think I still learned a lot.

                    I don't really have any questions about this meet-up, but I wish we had more time to talk about every method a little bit more.

            <h2>Web Developer Happy Hour & Showcase</h2>
            <h6>03/07/2018</h6>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aaron Middleton</strong> - Web Development recent graduate, job seeker.</li>
                <li><strong>Matt Steffey</strong> - Web Development recent graduate, job seeker.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This was a showcase event for General Assembly recent graduates. There were probably 10 graduates displaying their final project. Although this was 3 months web development program, the projects were mostly well done in my opinion. My favorite one was Matt's project. The app he built was able to take pictures, and if you, for example take a picture of an album cover, it brings up all the songs in that album on Spotify. I am sure there was a lot of back-end coding involved in his project.

                    A lot of these recently graduated students had game projects. Only couple of them had some interactive web apps. Aaron, for example, had an interesting project. It was an app where you can online shopping.
                    
                    I wondered why almost everybody had a game project at this event. Is it maybe something that they focus more at General Assembly, or is it a better way to get a job?

            <h2>March Develop Happy Hour</h2>
            <h6>03/13/2018</h6>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rachel Doren</strong>- Freelance Software Engineer</li>
                <li><strong>Jonathan Davito</strong>- Lead Designer, Developer at ZeroThree</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This was a very social event almost completely without the technical world of developers. Games, beers and conversations...

                I very much enjoyed this event, I think everybody did. I normally consider myself a shy person when it comes to networking, but, it is a lot easier to walk to somebody and meet them when you have glass of beer in your hand, or when everybody is playing some games. This kind of events are definitely a great way of learning about developer jobs from the real world especially for somebody like me who has never worked in the field. Learning about what a developer's work day is like is a very valuable information for me.
                
                It was not a technical event where you code or watch somebody coding, yet, for me, this event was full of information about web development world. I talked to many developers and learned about their jobs, lives and skills which gave some ideas about how much I need to be one of these talented people.
                
                I don't really have a question about this event, but instead, I have an obsevation after the meetup. Most of the people I talked to at this event were active web developers, and most of them had jobs, and almost all of these people were self-taught. They did't have computer science degrees or any other related degree. This really made me feel a little better when it comes to finding a job after graduating from Galvanize.
